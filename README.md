# Notes-downloading
My First Website Project - Notes Download Site
This is my first web development project, where I created a simple website using HTML and CSS. The goal of this website is to provide a platform where users can download notes on various topics.

Features:
HTML: Used to structure the webpage with sections like navigation, download links.
CSS: Styled the website to create a clean, user-friendly interface with an attractive design.
Download Section: Users can easily click on download buttons to access notes on different subjects.
Getting hands-on experience with HTML for building webpage structure.
Using CSS for design and layout customization.
Creating a functional download section for notes.
